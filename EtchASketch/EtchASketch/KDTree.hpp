		 * Constructs a KDTree from a vector of KDPoints, each having dimension
		 * Dim.
		 *
		 * You may assume the vector has at least one KDPoint in it. It should
		 * build the tree using recursive helper functions.
		 *
		 * Since we know the size of the KDTree at construction, we can
		 * represent the tree as a linear structure. For testing, we
		 * **require** the following:
		 *
		 * 1.  The root of a subtree in the KDTree containing array indicies
		 *     \f$\{a, a+1, a+2, ..., b-1, b\}\f$ **must** be in cell
		 *     \f$\left\lfloor\frac{a+b}{2}\right\rfloor\f$.
		 *
		 *     This means that, in particular, that the root of the KDTree is
		 *     positioned at index
		 *     \f$\left\lfloor\frac{0+(n-1)}{2}\right\rfloor\f$.
		 *
		 *     As you build the tree, your recursive tree building function
		 *     calls will refer to points on the left of this index, and to
		 *     points on the right of this index.
		 * 2.  The median node of n nodes is calculated as the cell
		 *     \f$\left\lfloor\frac{n-1}{2}\right\rfloor\f$. That is, the
		 *     middle node is selected if there are an odd number, and the
		 *     item before the middle if there are an even number. **If there
		 *     are ties (two points have equal value along a dimension), they
		 *     must be decided using KDPoint::operator<().** Although this is
		 *     arbitrary and doesn't affect the functionality of the KDTree,
		 *     it is required to be able to grade your code.
		 *
		 * KD-trees are created recursively; at any stage of the construction,
		 * the median value in the current dimension is selected. Then, all
		 * the elements in the current subtree are divided up into elements
		 * which are less than the median, or greater than the median, and
		 * then the subtrees are created recursively. The children pick the
		 * median in the next dimension, and repeat until the entire set of
		 * inputs has been processed. Successive levels of the tree split on
		 * increasing dimensions, modulo the total number: a 3D tree will
		 * have levels split by dimension 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, etc.
		 *
		 * @param newPoints The vector of points to build your KDTree off of.

		/**
		 * Finds the closest point to the parameter point in the KDTree.
		 *
		 * This function takes a reference to a template parameter KDPoint and
		 * returns the KDPoint closest to it in the tree. We are defining
		 * closest here to be the minimum Euclidean distance between elements.
		 * Again, **if there are ties (this time in distance), they must be
		 * decided using KDPoint::operator<().** Recall that an RGBAPixel is
		 * defined by three components: red, green, and blue.
		 *
		 * The findNearestNeighbor() search is done in two steps: a search to
		 * find the smallest hyperrectangle that contains the target element,
		 * and then a back traversal to see if any other hyperrectangle could
		 * contain a closer point, which may be a point with smaller distance
		 * or a point with equal distance, but a "smaller" point (as defined
		 * by operator< in the point class). In the first step, you must
		 * recursively traverse down the tree, at each level choosing the
		 * subtree which represents the region containing the search element
		 * (another place to save some duplicate code?). When you reach the
		 * lowest bounding hyperrectangle, then the corresponding node is
		 * effectively the "current best" neighbor.
		 *
		 * However, it may be the case that a better match exists outside of
		 * the containing hyperrectangle. At then end of first step of the
		 * search, we start traversing back up the kdtree to the parent node.
		 * The current best distance defines a radius which contains the
		 * nearest neighbor. During the back-traversal (i.e., stepping out of
		 * the recursive calls), you must first check if the distance to the
		 * parent node is less than the current radius. If so, then that
		 * distance now defines the radius, and we replace the "current best"
		 * match. Next, it is necessary to check to see if the current
		 * splitting plane's distance from search node is within the current
		 * radius. If so, then the opposite subtree could contain a closer
		 * node, and must also be searched recursively.
		 *
		 * During the back-traversal, it is important to only check the
		 * subtrees that are within the current radius, or else the efficiency
		 * of the kdtree is lost. If the distance from the search node to the
		 * splitting plane is greater than the current radius, then there
		 * cannot possibly be a better nearest neighbor in the subtree, so the
		 * subtree can be skipped entirely.
		 *
		 * findNearestNeighbor should only be called on a
		 * valid kd-tree.
